The COVID-19 pandemic needed a sophisticated data system to detect trends and anticipate viral propagation. Organizations and healthcare providers require COVID-19 data reporting that is accurate, timely, and consistent in order to make decisions and allocate resources effectively. Traditional data management approaches struggle to handle the amount, pace, and variety of pandemic data. Furthermore, they lack efficient, scalable systems for integrating several data sources and performing real-time analytics.

To solve these difficulties, this project intends to provide a cloud-based data engineering solution that uses Azure Data Factory (ADF) as the primary pipeline management tool, combining and converting data from many sources to enable data-driven insights. By leveraging Azure Storage, Databricks, HDInsight, and Power BI, this solution will produce daily updated reports and visualizations to assist in tracking COVID-19 trends.
